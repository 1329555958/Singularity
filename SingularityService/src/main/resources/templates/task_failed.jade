        p Recommended course of action: Task lost while running and may still be running unmonitored. It is recommended you investigate and manually kill the process.
      if !taskEverRan
        p Recommended course of action: Task lost before running. This is most likely an infrastructure issue. For further assistance email #{adminEmails}.
