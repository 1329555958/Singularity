<p>
	Are you sure you want to to decommission this {{ type }}?
</p>

<pre>{{ id }}</pre>

<p>
	Decommissioning a {{ type }} causes all tasks currently running on it to be rescheduled and executed elsewhere, as new tasks will no longer consider <code>{{ id }}</code> as a valid target for execution. This process may take time as replacement tasks must be considered healthy before old tasks are killed.
